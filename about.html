  <!--description of how my interest developed -->
  <p class="OutsideTable">
    I started skateboarding more often when the COVID-19 pandemic developed. With COVID-19,
    many of us were trapped indoors. I chose to skateboard because it would allow me to escape the
    indoors. Getting this fresh air was especially necessary after spending a couple ours on zoom in classes
    every day. Although I have always skateboarded, I started to skateboard more intensly during the past
    couple of months. Learning tricks on a skateboard was one of my goals. Although it takes many years
    to master many tricks, I was able to learn a couple over the summer.

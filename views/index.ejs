        <p>This is a video of the X-Games in Minneapolis in 2019. There are many different types of skateboarding in this video, such as street, big air, and others. Each of
        these variations has its own unique elements. My favorite is street because skaters can do these tricks in a skatepark and on the street.</p>

        <p>This is Leandre Sanders. Leandre is a new skater who has been catching the world by surprise. He is
        nicknamed "The Man with no Stance" as he is equally good standing goofy and regular (the former is
        right foot in front and the latter is the left foot in front) on a skateboard. He is one of my favorite
        skaters right now as he has a very unique style.</p>

      <div class = "col-4 text">
        <p>This is a skateboarding an interesting skateboarding podcast. They talk about interesting developments in the skateboarding
        world. They also have some cool interviews with some notable skateboarders.</p>
